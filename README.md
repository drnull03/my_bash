# My Custom Bash Configuration (`.bashrc` and `.bash_profile`)

Hello and welcome to my personal collection of Bash configuration files\! This repository contains my `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile` files, which I use to customize my command-line environment.

I've decided to share them on GitHub.

These files are a continuous work in progress. My goal is to enrich them with powerful aliases, useful functions, and other features that make life on the command line more efficient and enjoyable.
